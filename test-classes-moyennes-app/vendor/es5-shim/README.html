<p><code>es5-shim.js</code> and <code>es5-shim.min.js</code> monkey-patch a JavaScript context to
contain all EcmaScript 5 methods that can be faithfully emulated with a
legacy JavaScript engine.</p>

<p><code>es5-sham.js</code> and <code>es5-sham.min.js</code> monkey-patch other ES5 methods as
closely as possible.  For these methods, as closely as possible to ES5
is not very close.  Many of these shams are intended only to allow code
to be written to ES5 without causing run-time errors in older engines.
In many cases, this means that these shams cause many ES5 methods to
silently fail.  Decide carefully whether this is what you want.</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>The tests are written with the Jasmine BDD test framework.
To run the tests, navigate to &lt;root-folder>/tests/.</p>

<p>In order to run against the shim-code, the tests attempt to kill the current
implementation of the missing methods. This happens in &lt;root-folder>/tests/helpers/h-kill.js.
So in order to run the tests against the built-in methods, invalidate that file somehow
(comment-out, delete the file, delete the script-tag, etc.).</p>

<h2>Shams</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>/?\ Object.create</p>

<p>  For the case of simply &ldquo;begetting&rdquo; an object that
  inherits prototypically from another, this should work
  fine across legacy engines.</p>

<p>  /!\ Object.create(null) will work only in browsers that
  support prototype assignment.  This creates an object
  that does not have any properties inherited from
  Object.prototype.  It will silently fail otherwise.</p>

<p>  /!\ The second argument is passed to
  Object.defineProperties which will probably fail
  silently.</p></li>
<li><p>/?\ Object.getPrototypeOf</p>

<p>  This will return &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; in some cases.  It uses
  <strong>proto</strong> if it&rsquo;s available.  Failing that, it uses
  constructor.prototype, which depends on the constructor
  property of the object&rsquo;s prototype having not been
  replaced.  If your object was created like this, it
  won&rsquo;t work:</p>

<pre><code>  function Foo() {
  }
  Foo.prototype = {};
</code></pre>

<p>  Because the prototype reassignment destroys the
  constructor property.</p>

<p>  This will work for all objects that were created using
  <code>Object.create</code> implemented with this library.</p></li>
<li><p>/!\ Object.getOwnPropertyNames</p>

<p>  This method uses Object.keys, so it will not be accurate
  on legacy engines.</p></li>
<li><p>Object.isSealed</p>

<p>  Returns &ldquo;false&rdquo; in all legacy engines for all objects,
  which is conveniently guaranteed to be accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Object.isFrozen</p>

<p>  Returns &ldquo;false&rdquo; in all legacy engines for all objects,
  which is conveniently guaranteed to be accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Object.isExtensible</p>

<p>  Works like a charm, by trying very hard to extend the
  object then redacting the extension.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Fail silently</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>/!\ Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor</p>

<p>  The behavior of this shim does not conform to ES5.  It
  should probably not be used at this time, until its
  behavior has been reviewed and been confirmed to be
  useful in legacy engines.</p></li>
<li><p>/!\ Object.defineProperty</p>

<p>  This method will silently fail to set &ldquo;writable&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;enumerable&rdquo;, and &ldquo;configurable&rdquo; properties.</p>

<p>  Providing a getter or setter with &ldquo;get&rdquo; or &ldquo;set&rdquo; on a
  descriptor will silently fail on engines that lack
  &ldquo;<strong>defineGetter</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>defineSetter</strong>&rdquo;, which include
  all versions of IE up to version 8 so far.</p>

<p>  IE 8 provides a version of this method but it only works
  on DOM objects.  Thus, the shim will not get installed
  and attempts to set &ldquo;value&rdquo; properties will fail
  silently on non-DOM objects.</p>

<p>  https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/issues#issue/5</p></li>
<li><p>/!\ Object.defineProperties</p>

<p>  This uses the Object.defineProperty shim</p></li>
<li><p>Object.seal</p>

<p>  Silently fails on all legacy engines.  This should be
  fine unless you are depending on the safety and security
  provisions of this method, which you cannot possibly
  obtain in legacy engines.</p></li>
<li><p>Object.freeze</p>

<p>  Silently fails on all legacy engines.  This should be
  fine unless you are depending on the safety and security
  provisions of this method, which you cannot possibly
  obtain in legacy engines.</p></li>
<li><p>Object.preventExtensions</p>

<p>  Silently fails on all legacy engines.  This should be
  fine unless you are depending on the safety and security
  provisions of this method, which you cannot possibly
  obtain in legacy engines.</p></li>
</ul>
